          <p class="text-black text-xl mb-8">
              This is a beekeeping app that I am currently working on. It is an android app that will allow beekeepers to track their hives and the health of their bees as well as things like inspections and treatments.
              <br><br>
              The app is coded in Kotlin and uses the Android Jetpack libraries, Material 3 for the user interface, Room for the database, and Retrofit for HTTP requests. Additionally, it employs the Hilt dependency injection library and adheres to the Clean Architecture pattern for layer separation.            </p>
